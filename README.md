# collabdocs
This is an app for demonstrating how to use the mset package to implement a collaborative editor.
The goal of the project is to build an editor that supports thousands of simultaneous editors without
any noticeable lag. The user's own edits appear in real-time on their screen and remote edit operations
are handled "between keystrokes".
